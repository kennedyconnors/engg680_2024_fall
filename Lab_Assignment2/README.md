## What is assignment 2 about?
```This repository contains the files for Lab Assignment 2 of ENGG680, which focuses on implementing Non-linear Least Squares Estimation (LSE) using Python. The assignment involves developing an algorithm for Single Point Positioning (SPP) with data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The project covers both Linear and Non-linear LSE techniques, and students are expected to manage their work using Git for version control. ```
