## What is Assignment 4 about?
```Lab Assignment 4 involves implementing machine learning techniques to classify vehicle motion states using inertial sensor data. The primary objectives include training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to distinguish between rest, straight driving, and turning states, with a focus on hyperparameter tuning through grid search and cross-validation. Key tasks include evaluating the model on multiple test datasets, using feature subsets, exploring dimensionality reduction with PCA, and comparing different classification algorithms.```
